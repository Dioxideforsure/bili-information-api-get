# bili-information-api-get

A little project for koishi bot, but keep update till I finish it.

## What can it do?

It can fetch the json from api built to satisfy the need.

## How does it work?

Node video-json-helper.js <BVID> or <AID>.
It will download and save to the root of json file.

## Is this functional?

Maybe, but I will review the code to debug.
